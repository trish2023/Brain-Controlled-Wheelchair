# Brain-Controlled-Wheelchair


ðŸ§  Brain-Controlled Wheelchair â€“ EEG + Blink-Based Navigation
This repository contains the implementation of a real-time Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system designed to help individuals with severe motor impairments control a wheelchair using only their brain signals and eye blinks.

Using EEG data from the Neiry BCI headset and blink patterns detected via OpenCV, the system interprets user intent through a combination of cognitive state classification and blink-based commands. A lightweight Decision Tree or CNN-LSTM model processes the EEG inputs, while a rule-based logic layer fuses it with blink events to issue commands such as move forward, turn left/right, or stop.

This repo includes everything from data collection and model training to real-time inference, logging, and control logic â€” all geared toward accessible, low-cost, and explainable assistive technology.
